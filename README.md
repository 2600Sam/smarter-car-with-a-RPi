# smarter-car-with-a-RPi
I using a Raspberry Pi to make my car a little smarter (maybe. hopefully). I am copying a lot of code from
the Tinkernut ( https://www.hackster.io/tinkernut/raspberry-pi-smart-car-8641ca ).
I will be doing a lot in Python3 (because I'm trying to learn that language).
This won't be one big program but smaller python scripts and other programs 
So far I will be using a Raspberry Pi 3b+, Python3, pygame, tkinter
